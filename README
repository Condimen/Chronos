Chronos, by Juan Ortiz Zaforas (@condimen)


Is a very simple chronometer built with CSS animations and a bit of JavaScript

Features
	- Tenth of second, second, minute and hour hands
	- Start/stop button
	- Keyboard shortcuts for start/stop (s or p) and reset (r)

Feel free to use it. I'd appreciate if you give credit.

Have fun!
