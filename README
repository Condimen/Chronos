Chronos, by Juan Ortiz Zaforas (@condimen)


Is a very simple chronometer built with CSS animations and a bit of JavaScript

Features
	- Tenth of second, second, minute and hour hands
	- Start/stop button
	- Keyboard shortcuts for start/stop (s or p) and reset (r)
	- More to comeâ€¦ (reset button is #1)

Known bugs
	- Start/stop doesn't work properly in Chrome 19 (it does on 20)
	- Strange behaviour of "Fork tag" when the chronometer starts
	- -webkit prefix only (Prefix Free to be added)



Feel free to use it. I'd appreciate very much if you give credit.

Have fun!
